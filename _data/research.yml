  description: "The upper ocean plays a crucial role in the Earth system as it connects the atmosphere, whose properties vary quickly, to the deep ocean, which varies very slowly and stores enormous amounts of heat, gases, and momentum. I study the physics of turbulence, which mediates the transfer of properties across this upper ocean interface. I am particularly interested in how waves on the ocean surface change the properties of upper ocean turbulence.  "
