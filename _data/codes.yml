  network: github
  url: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl
  description: ' A large eddy simulation (LES) model for simulating three-dimensional turbulent flows, like upper-ocean dynamics. This code is written in Julia.'
- name: GeophysicalFlows.jl
  network: github
  url: https://github.com/FourierFlows/GeophysicalFlows.jl
  description: ' Simulates large-scale dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, where flows are two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-geostrophic (almost 2D). The documentation for this model is concise and clear, which makes it realtively easy to get started with it! This code is written in Julia.'
- name: Community Earth System Model (CESM)
  network: github
  url: http://www.cesm.ucar.edu
  description: ' A complex model that simulates the global Earth system (oceans, atmosphere, cryosphere etc.). CESM is one of the computer models used in the IPCC report, and it is well-documented, easy to modify, and has varying levels of complexity that can be switched on or off.'
- name: The General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) and the Community Ocean Vertical Mixing Project (CVMix)
  network: github
  url: https://github.com/qingli411/gotmwork
  description: ' Both of these are computer models that simulate the mixing effects of turbulence in the vertical direction, which is crucial for the upper ocean`s evolution. Qing Li (LANL) has coupled these models so that we can evaluate existing ways of accounting for mixing (parameterizations), and test new parameterizations that we develop.'
